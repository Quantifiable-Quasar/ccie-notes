# DMVPN 
## Overview

The objective of this lab is to configure DMVPN. First, the configs are pretty much copied and pasted from [Cisco Docs](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/sec_conn_dmvpn/configuration/15-mt/sec-conn-dmvpn-15-mt-book/sec-conn-dmvpn-dmvpn.html). Below are the objectives that modify this configuration to achieve additional objectives.Â

4.  Delete link and create dual-hub multi cloud
5.  Migrate to IKEv2
