These are all of my notes for the CCIE Security v6.1! I tried to organize things by exam objective, but at some points it overlaps a bit. I genuinely don't know how to take notes, so I more or less just have implementation guides here. The lab section houses more comprehensive, larger-scale labs, and the section under the exam objective will be more topical, individual labs. Also I plan on having short notes that describe conceptually what's going on where necessary. 

I have some plans for programmatic troubleshooting which will end up in the same github repo as these notes, and I'll add more as that comes out. Right now, I'm working off of CML Personal, so I am limited to 20 nodes at a time. This shouldn't be a massive issue as of now, but we shall see how that unfolds in the future.
