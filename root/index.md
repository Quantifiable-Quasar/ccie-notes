These are all of my notes for the CCIE Security v6.1! I tried to organize things by exam objective, but at some points it overlaps a bit. I genuinely don't know how to take notes, so I more or less just have implementation guides here. There will be some basic conceptual stuff under the exam objective, and labs that cover a few objectives will be put in the “Labs” folder of the exam category. 

I have some plans for programmatic troubleshooting which will end up in the same github repo as these notes, and I'll add more as that comes out. Right now, I'm working off of CML Free tier, so I'm doing the objectives that I feel are most conducive to that environment. In the future, I will migrate to CML Personal so I can get FTDs and ISE.
